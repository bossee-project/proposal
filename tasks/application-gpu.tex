  title=Demonstrator: Visualisation and control of fluid dynamics in Jupyter notebook,
  id=application-gpu,

  partners={EGI}

In this task (see page \pageref{sec:concept-demonstrator-gpu}), we will contruct tools for editing and inspecting
boundary conditions. Having such tools as Jupyter widgets will allow
to complete the workflow without leaving Jupyter notebook. We plan the
following activities
\begin{compactitem}
\item Development of Jupyter notebooks using fluid
  simulation based on the high-performance Sailfish-cfd solver.
\item Implementing advanced widgets for data visualisation of large
  fluid dynamics simulations.
\item Implementing widgets for inspection and editing boundary
  conditions in LBM.
\end{compactitem}

This work will closely interact in with the task
\taskref{ecosystem}{jupyter-widgets}: it will both provide guidelines
for the development to \taskref{ecosystem}{jupyter-widgets} and serve
as test case for implemented features in
\taskref{ecosystem}{jupyter-widgets}.

The deliverable of this part will be a demonstrator
(\localdelivref{demonstrators}) available via the EOSC hub, and
contributions to report \localdelivref{applications-report}.

\end{task}
