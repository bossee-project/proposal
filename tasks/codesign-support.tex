This task coordinates and supports the work of the other \WPref{applications}
tasks. It will help us exploit synergies and coordinate the
gathering and formulation of requirements and the
preparation of the deliverables. It will also support demonstrator efforts to
speed-up the development process and ease the deployment of innovative
services. Finally, it will drive the co-design cycle between
\WPref{applications} and all the technical work packages
(\WPref{core}, \WPref{ecosystem} and \WPref{eosc}).

\begin{compactitem}
\item Assess co-design efforts and distribute workload across the core
  developers
\item Regularly feedback information to \WPref{education} to adapt
  trainings and dissemination
\item Offer technical support to the demonstrators throughout all the
  steps until final deployment of the services
\item Liase with \taskref{eosc}{eosc} for authentication,
  authorisation, data management and further EOSC integration.
\end{compactitem}
