  id=reproducibility-euxfel,
  lead=EuXFEL,
  PM=36,
  wphases={0-48},
  partners={}
]
  A major category of experiments already begun at European XFEL revolve around
  X-ray crystallography, using X-ray scattering to resolve molecular structures.
  Processing the data collected to produce meaningful structures is a
  significant computational task, and researchers have developed complex
  software for this, such as CrystFEL, Cheetah and CCTBX.
  % How do I properly cross-reference another task or workpackage?
  As an application of the reproducible workflows task in WP2, we will build
  workflows around such software, aiming to allow 'one button' replication
  of published structures once the raw data is made available.
  As part of European XFEL's data policy, all data is to be publicly available
  ?? years after it is collected.
  The task includes the following activities:
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item ...
    (\localdelivref{deliv-id})
  \end{compactitem}
\end{task}
