  title=Demonstrator: enriched teaching with Jupyter,
  id=teaching,
  lead=EP,

  wphases={0-48},

  In this task (see page \pageref{sec:concept-demonstrator-teaching}
  for context), we will \textbf{deliver and help deliver Jupyter-based
    courses at a large scale} in our own institutions, as a mean to
  \textbf{inform, evaluate, provide feedback on, and demonstrate the
    value of the work performed} in this project in the context of
  higher education, as well as to \textbf{develop and share best
    practices} and \textbf{demonstrate and disseminate} Jupyter's full
  potential for teaching.

  \'Ecole polytechnique and Université Paris-Sud are particularly well
  suited for this task because they
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item host a variety of local infrastructure (dedicated servers,
    local cloud, computer labs, ...);
  \item host a reactive community with highly qualified research
    software engineers (DevOps, software developers), researchers,
    professors, and students that have been working together on this
    topic for several years, with close collaboration between the two
    sites;
  \item offer very diverse courses, in many disciplines, and ranging
    from large lower undergraduate courses to specialized classes for
    graduate students and top notch engineers;
  \item have strong support from their respective teaching departments.
  \end{enumerate}

  The task will include the following activities
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Reinforce the use of Jupyter technology in courses at
    all levels, notably in Mathematics and Data Science, in close
    collaboration between Ecole polytechnique and Université Paris Sud;
  \item Test the new developments and feed back to tasks
    \taskref{core}{jh-bh-conv}, \taskref{ecosystem}{xeus-cpp}, \taskref{ecosystem}{teaching-tools}, \taskref{applications}{math} and \taskref{eosc}{jh-bh-deployment};
  \item Follow up on a successful Jupyter day in
    2018~\footnote{\url{http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~massot/Personal_web_page_of_Marc_Massot/JupyterX.html}}
    by organizing a yearly Jupyter event showcasing the latest
    advances for teaching and research;
  \item Foster sharing of experience, best practices and course
    material, at the local level, and then worldwide, through meetups,
    blogs, etc.
  \item Publish selected teaching material for interactive use on
    \TheProject's EOSC services (\delivref{applications}{demonstrators}).
  \end{compactitem}
  The work carried out will be reported on in
  \delivref{applications}{applications-report}.
