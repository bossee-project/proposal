  The aim of this task is to provide communities with online resources for Open Science and support \taskref{education}{workshops}.
  This task includes the following activities:
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Collaboration with the \href{https://coderefinery.org}{CodeRefinery} project for the development and maintainance of the \href{https://coderefinery.org/lessons/}{online lesson materials} on open science best practices (JupyterLab, version control, collaboration and peer review, documentation, testing, software licensing, and reproducible research).
  This material is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/}{CC BY-SA 4.0}.
  \item Development of an interactive book on applied Stochastic processes in Physics. Unlike classical books in this subject, it will be supplemented by numerical examples of solving real case problems. We will emphasize the
role of high performance computing in solving problems modeled by stochastic differential equations (SDE). Materials will contain examples of using GPU computing in solving SDE. The deliverable of this part will be available via the EOSC hub, and will use HPC hardware available. (\localdelivref{sde-book})
