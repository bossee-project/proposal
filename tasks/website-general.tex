This task comprises all forms of direct dissemination and public
communication activities such as press releases, creation of the
project web-site including visitor analysis and monitoring tools,
scientific and technical publications, outreach activities
(seminars, keynote talks, media interviews, press releases),
promotion through social media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn),
creation of advertisement materials such as flyers, posters, and
electronic feeds as well as their distribution. We will use standard
community building technology such as mailing lists, Wikis and
Forums, to ensure dissemination and engagement of the community to
support this. We will also generate press releases at appropriate
moments.
