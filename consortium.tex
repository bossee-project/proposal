%remove this, as we have more pressing things left.

\eucommentary{\begin{compactitem}
\item
Describe the consortium. How will it match the project's objectives?
How do the members complement one another (and cover the value chain,
where appropriate)? In what way does each of them contribute to the
project? How will they be able to work effectively together?
\item
If applicable, describe the industrial/commercial involvement in the
project to ensure exploitation of the results and explain why this is
consistent with and will help to achieve the specific measures which
are proposed for exploitation of the results of the project (see section 2.3).
\item
Other countries: If one or more of the participants requesting EU funding
is based in a country that is not automatically eligible for such funding
(entities from Member States of the EU, from Associated Countries and
from one of the countries in the exhaustive list included in General
Annex A of the work programme are automatically eligible for EU funding),
 explain why the participation of the entity in question is essential to
 carrying out the project

The \TheProject consortium spans the broad spectrum of actors required
for successfully developing an apt and easy-to-navigate sustainable service
accessible through the EOSC hub catering to the needs of the European
scientific community. It is composed of 4 academic institutions, 4 research
centres and 2 SMEs based in 6 different countries (Norway, France,
Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Switzerland).\TODO{Haven't counted EGI
  here - not sure what they are.}
The Consortium ensures a critical mass of scientific expertise and excellence
in key areas \TODO{(areas)} with research organisations and SMEs of recognised
 international reputation. Namely, \TheProject consortium brings in:
\begin{compactitem}
\item A set of use cases that cover several application domains and users, and that impose very diverse
requirements on EOSC infrastructure (European XFEL, CDS ASTRO, UiO, INSERM);
\item Lead developers in the Jupyter Ecosystem, including IPython, the Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab,
JupyterHub, Binder, MyBinder.org, Jupyter Widgets located at Simula, European XFEL, QuantStack, and
WildTreeTech,
as referenced in section \ref{jupyter-ecosystem}.
\item Experts and major promoters of the Jupyter collaborative user interfaces for interactive and exploratory
computing in a variety of scientific domains (Centre de Donnees
astronomiques de Strasbourg, European XFEL,
INSERM, QuantStack, Paris-Sud, \'Ecole Polytechnique, Silesia,
University of Oslo).
\item A long experience and proven track record of success with large and complex collaborative projects,
including projects focused on large-scale infrastructures and large experimental services (EGI, XFEL) as well
as experience in running large scale open source projects (Jupyter project)
\item A comprehensive range of skill sets and competencies in several relevant domains, from applied
research to standardisation to business
analysis.
\end{compactitem}

The consortium has developed through collaborations and common interests over recent years.
Some partners have been working together on different aspects of Jupyter
and software for education for many years (European XFEL, QuantStack, Simula, Wild Tree Tech),
while others joined together during a previous successful EU H2020 project OpenDreamKit (European XFEL,
Paris-Sud, Silesia, Simula).
During the course of OpenDreamKit, Paris-Sud and \'Ecole Polytechnique
ran JupyterDays events, bringing in interested members of the research community.
These community workshops led to connections with application-domain sites such as INSERM and CDS
ASTRO,
and UiO has organized similar workshops with the participation of Simula.

Finally, we note the project partners feel passionate about Open Science and
\emph{have chosen to write this proposal fully in the open} on GitHub
(\href{http://github.com/bossee-project/proposal}{http://github.com/bossee-project/proposal}) for maximum transparency.
We have used the same open source collaboration tools and practices
as the Open Source Open Science community.

In addition to the joint planning and writing period for this
proposal, the project partners have been interacting through a number of
other activities, including:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Joint software development

  \item Binder and repo2docker (\site{SRL}, \site{WTT})
  \item thebelab (\site{QS}, \site{SRL}, \site{UPSUD})
  \item nbval (\site{XFEL}, \site{SRL})
  \end{itemize}

\item Joint projects
  \begin{itemize}
  \item OpenDreamKit (\site{XFEL}, \site{SRL}, \site{UPSUD}, \site{SIL})

  (\site{SRL}, \site{SIL}), 2014-2017
  \item Computers in Science Education:iCSE (\site{SIL}, \site{UIO}), funded by EFS, 2011-2014.
    \end{itemize}

\item Joint publications
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Jupyter Notebooks -- a publishing format for
      reproducible computational workflows} \cite{Kluyver2016} (\site{XFEL}, \site{SRL}, \site{QS})
  \end{itemize}

\item Collaboration
  \begin{itemize}
  \item MyBinder for teaching and reproducibility (\site{XFEL}, \site{SRL}, \site{WTT})
  \item Widgets for computational science (\site{XFEL}, \site{QS}, \site{SIL})
  \item OpenGATE, Monte Carlo platform for medical applications (
    \site{INSERM}, \site{UPSUD})
