  % type is one of:
  % - leadPI: leader of the participating institution
  % - PI: Principal Investigator
  % - R: researcher?
  % Who is the coordinator is specified elsewhere

  % PM=YYY:
  % A fair evaluation of the number of months you will be
  % spending on this specific project along the four years.
  % Typical numbers:
  % - full time hired personnel: 48 months
  % - lead PI or proposal coordinator: 8-12 months
  % - PI: 4-5 months
  % - participant: 2-6 months

  % salary=ZZZ:
  % Approximate monthly gross salary (in term of total cost for the
  % employer). This is optional. If you are uncomfortable having this
  % information in a public file, you can alternatively send the
  % information to Eugenia Shadlova, or to your institution
  % leader/manager if he is willing to fill in himself the budget
  % forms on the eu portal.

  % The above information is used to fill in various tables in the
  % proposal file, and to evaluate the cost of the project for the
  % institutions.

  % Nicolas.Thiery.tex for an example.
