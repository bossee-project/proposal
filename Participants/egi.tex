\begin{sitedescription}{EGI}


The EGI Foundation (also known as Stichting EGI and abbreviated as EGI.eu) 
is a not-for-profit foundation established under the Dutch law to coordinate 
the EGI Federation (abbreviated as EGI), an international collaboration that 
federates the digital capabilities, resources and expertise of national and 
international research communities in Europe and worldwide. 
The main goal is to empower researchers from all disciplines to collaborate 
and to carry out data- and compute-intensive science and innovation. 
The EGI Foundation coordinates areas such as overseeing infrastructure operations, 
user community support, contact with technology providers, strategy and policy 
development, flagship events and dissemination of news and achievements. 
As part of its mandate, the EGI Foundation actively represents the EGI federation 
at European level with policy makers and funding agencies, it provides expert 
advice to shape policies and funding programs and also support the implementation 
of the policy priorities. 
The EGI Foundation holds certifications in both ISO/IEC 9000 “Quality Management” 
and ISO/IEC 20000 “IT Service Management”.
