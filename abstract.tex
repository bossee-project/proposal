\begin{abstract}

  To truly achieve the societal goals of Open Science,
  we must make progress beyond the `mere availability' of scientific results,
  to the practical usability and exploitation of such data once it is made available,
  an area where there is much room for improvement.
  The Jupyter project and its ecosystem show great promise
  as tools for bridging this gap; for making Open Science
  useful and accessible to all,
  from researchers to educators to public citizens.
  The Jupyter notebook and Jupyter ecosystem are of increasing
  importance in computational science, data science, academia,
  industry, governments, and service providers,
  used by millions worldwide.
  Jupyter notebooks have great potential to push Open Science
  forward because they provide a complete description of a
  computational study that can be turned into a publication
  or produce part of a publication, such as a figure,
  thus enabling reproducibility of complex tasks.
  The Jupyter-based Binder project adds the execution of such notebooks
  in specified computational environments, an aspect of reproducibility
  not yet widely supported
  and a great opportunity for improvement to Open Science practices.
  The web-based nature of notebooks makes them an ideal component for Open Science Services,
  being accessible with only a web browser
  while executing anywhere from a local laptop to a remote supercomputer.
  In \TheProject, we will extend the capabilities of the Jupyter
  tools and ecosystem to add functionality that we view as having great
  importance for EOSC and Open Science more
  widely and operate services on EOSC as a demonstration.

  Many \TheProject partners have longstanding experience and
  leadership roles in the Jupyter ecosystem,
  and in deploying services built on Jupyter to many users across the globe.
  Complementary to this core expertise,
  we integrate partners focussing on the application of these tools from a wide range of disciplines,
  both to demonstrate and ensure that our developments serve real-world Open Science use cases.
