The purpose of the management procedures is maximised support for
individual scientists to achieve the project objectives, progress control
of each WP, coordination of the different project activities,
implementation of quality control mechanisms by defining
appropriate standards, as well as targeted dissemination of knowledge.
Project management activities in \TheProject will comprise a wide array
of activities, including scientific and administrative management,
guidance on decision making, contractual management, financial
management, supervision of and compliance to ethical standards,
management of knowledge and IPR issues, and coordination of
communication activities. Most partners have extensive experience
with EU funded projects, while two SMEs are recent start-ups.
\TheProject management will thus be tailored to varying needs and
requirements of individual partners.

\subsubsection{Management}

The project will be coordinated by Simula (\site{SRL}),
represented by Benjamin Ragan-Kelley (Project Coordinator), who has
experience in successfully managing several research projects on the
main \TheProject topics. \TODO{update}.

The Project Coordinator will be assisted by a part-time (50\%) Project
Manager, Katarina Subakova, who has significant experience with Horizon 2020, both 
as a project manager and as a head of Horizon 2020 Helpdesk.  
Additional feedback and expertise will be brought by Financial, Legal
and European affairs officers from \TODO{...}.

In addition, Hans Fanghor will act as Project Deputy, being constantly
updated by the coordinator and manager on the project evolution in
order to be able to temporarily take over the coordination in case the
coordinator would be incapacitated.

\subsubsection{Organisational structure and decision-making}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{management_structure.pdf}
  \caption{Management structure}
  \label{figure.management}
\end{figure}

The organisational structure, shown in the Figure~\ref{figure.management}, has been designed
to enable efficient coordination of the project --- \TODO{update}the
development and evaluation of a VRE toolkit
integrating several previously separated tools and software and
involving both academic actors and industrial stakeholders. It is jointly agreed on 
by \TheProject consortium and adapted to its size and composition, 
the tasks and duties of all partners involved. 

We have designed the management structure and procedures to deal in a
flexible manner with the following challenges:
\begin{compactitem}
\item to integrate all consortium members and to mobilise their
  expertise, knowledge and networks at every stage of the project;
\item to give the maximum attention to the end-users needs and
  requirements;
\item to continuously involve expertise and knowledge of relevant
  stakeholders and their networks, and
\item to efficiently coordinate the project implementation in a
  collaborative environment and ensure its sustainability.
\end{compactitem}

The design has been largely adapted from that of OpenDreamKit which
has proved very effective for this type of project, with some
simplification as suggested by past experience.
\begin{itemize}
\item Suppression of the Quality Review Board: its role can
  effectively be subsumed by the steering committee; also the head of
  OpenDreamKit's Quality Review Board, Hans Fanghor, will carry over
  the accumulated experience and best practices.
\item Suppression of the End User Group: as in OpenDreamKit, all
  participants are either end users themselves, or in close contact
  with such end users. To guarantee the effectiveness of this
  simplified structure, we included end users in the advisory board.
\end{itemize}


The coordinator acts as an intermediary between the Partners and
the European Commission. The coordinator will oversee the project
planning, monitor that execution is carried out in time and that
the objectives are achieved and closely interact with the project
officer for project monitoring and delivery of the performance
indicators.  The Project Manager will ensure  efficient day-to-day
management of the project, reporting, feedback to partners on
administrative, financial and legal issues, tracking of  resource
allocation and consumption, and communication inside and outside the
consortium.

The resources of all partners will be mobilised by decentralisation of
responsibilities through the assignment of leadership for work
packages. Clear distribution of tasks, efficient decision making
mechanisms and a sound financial management will safeguard the
achievement of the project's objectives.

\subsubsection{Project roles}

%Project Coordinator and Project Manager can meet any time and at least
%twice a week.

The following bodies will form the organisational structure of the
\TheProject project : Coordination Team (MT), Steering Committee (SC),
Advisory Board (AB).%, End User Group (EUG) and Quality Review board (QRB).

\begin{description}
\item{\textbf{Coordination Team (CT)}} \nobreak\par
\textbf{Members:} The CT is composed of the Work Package leaders
and headed by the Project Coordinator, assisted by the Project
Manager.

\textbf{Responsibilities:} The CT is an executive body in charge of
the project implementation and monitoring.
It takes operational decisions necessary for the smooth execution of
the project.

\textbf{Tasks:}
\begin{compactenum}
\item Monitoring the timely execution of the tasks and achievement of
  the objectives;
\item Preparation of scientific and financial progress reports;
\item Controlling Work Package progress by assessing it through technical
  reports developed by the partners;
\item Making proposals to the Steering Committee of re-allocation of
  tasks, resources and financial needs for the fulfilment of the work
  plan;
\item Preparing the drafts and validating the project deliverables to
  be submitted to the Commission.
\end{compactenum}

\textbf{Meetings:} They will meet Work-Package leaders every 6 months.
If necessary, extra meetings will be arranged.

\item{\textbf{Steering Committee (SC)}}\nobreak\par

\textbf{Members:} The SC is chaired by the Project Coordinator
and includes one representative from each partner organisation.

\textbf{Responsibilities:} The SC is the decision-making body in
charge of the strategic orientation of the project.  It takes decisions on scientific
directions, re-allocation of resources, consortium
changes and intellectual property rights.

\textbf{Meetings:} Biyearly. If necessary, extra-meetings
will be arranged.  Written minutes of each meeting will be produced,
which shall be the formal record of all decisions taken. A procedure
for comment and acceptance is proposed.

\textbf{Voting procedure:} The SC shall not deliberate until a quorum
of three-fourth (3/4) of all Members are present (possibly through
video-conference) or represented. Each Member shall have one vote. The
SC will work on consensual decisions as much as possible and resort to
voting only if unavoidable. Voting decisions shall be taken by a
majority of two-thirds (2/3) of votes with quorum two-thids (2/3) of
the whole set of members. Exceptional decisions (large changes to the
budget ($\geq$ 100k euros), evolution to the consortium, firing the
coordinator, resolving ambiguity about whether something is a hard
question) shall be taken by a majority of three-fourth (3/4) of votes
with quorum three-fourth (3/4) of the whole set of members. Votes can
be electronic.

\item{\textbf{Advisory board (AB)}} \nobreak\par

  \textbf{Members:} top level experts and end-users from partner and
  external organisations, from a variety of disciplines and both from
  academic and industrial sector. Together, they have a deep
  understanding of both market and technical problems, and an
  awareness of opportunities

  \textbf{Responsibilities:} to give an independent opinion on
  steering, scientific and innovation matters, in order to guaranty
  quality implementation of the project, adequateness to the end-users
  needs, efficient innovation management, and project sustainability.

  % \textbf{Tasks:} to control the project execution from the point of
  % view of the end user needs and requirements, to test the tool and to
  % detect its potential shortcomings at the early stages, to propose
  % adaptation measures.

  \textbf{Meetings:} at the request of the Steering Committee.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Project management tools and procedures}

Project partners and management bodies will communicate through
a dedicated project web platform, maintained by the Project
Manager. WP leaders will monitor progress of
participants of their WP at least monthly, and participants will inform their WP
leaders when problems are encountered. Major problems will be
discussed in (teleconference) meetings with the Project Coordinator
and Project Manager. Each WP leader will be free to organise
extra meetings with WP partners, if necessary. Scientific and
financial progress reports will be collected, assembled and
transmitted to the Project Coordinator by the WP leaders through the
web platform. On basis of the Progress Reports, the Coordination Team
will monitor progress of the project, identify bottlenecks and find
solutions for these problems. Where needed, adaptations to the project
plan will be made, with the aim of ensuring the delivery of the project
results as agreed with the EC. Major adaptations need to be approved
by the Steering Committee.

The Coordination Team, will ensure efficient innovation management.
They will carefully monitor new opportunities in order to suggest, if
necessary, to new directions to the Steering Committee. For legal
aspects, the latter will have a feedback from legal officers from the
Coordinator’s European Affairs and Technology Transfer office (SAIC),\TODO{Update}
specialised in Intellectual Property.

Our management structure and procedures will ensure that our network
of partners from both academic and industrial sectors is focused at
achieving the promised tasks and deliverables, efficiently managing
the innovation process and largely opening the VRE to its final users.
The partners will sign a Consortium Agreement, in which operational
rules and decision making procedures will be laid down.

\subsubsection{Risks and risk management strategy}\label{sec:risks}

The risk in the project execution as planned is carefully assessed and
managed. We base our plans on long standing experience, and we bring
together the world's experts in the relevant tools and techniques.

A key feature of this project is the involvement of a wide set of
partners from multiple domains. While this ensures complementary
coverage of a wide set of skills and provides robustness in different
ways, we will have to ensure that all partners work as closely knit
team. 

Our open source approach means that all our code and outputs
are open and visible to anybody at sites like Github and bitbucket
throughout the project. In particular, it is common for users of
computational software to use the leading edge versions, thus
beta-testing code in-between major releases. This results in risk
reduction: where our design decision or technical approaches are
controversial, this will be detected early by those users, giving the
consortium useful feedback to consider.

The project coordinator will, with support from the Coordination Team
and Quality Review Board, create a Risk Management Plan
\delivref{management}{ipr} as part of the Management Work Package,
which will be reviewed annually.

   \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{
    \textit{General technical / scientific risks}
   }
   \\\hline
  
  Implementing infrastructure that does not match the needs of end users & High/Low &
  Most of the members of the consortium are themselves end-users with
  a diverse range of needs and points of views; hence the design of
  the proposal and the governance of the project is naturally steered
  by demand; besides, because we provide a toolkit, users have the
  flexibility to adapt the infrastructure to their needs.\\\hline
  
  Lack of predictability for tasks that are pursued jointly with
  the community & Medium/Low &
  The PI's have a strong experience managing community-developed
  projects where the execution of tasks depends on the availability of
  partners. Some tasks may end up requiring more manpower from
  \TheProject to be completed on time, while others may be entirely
  taken care of by the community. Reallocating tasks and redefining
  work plans is common practice needed to cater for a
  fast evolving context. Such random factors will be averaged out over
  the large number of independent tasks.\\\hline
  
  Reliance on external software components & Medium/Low & The non trivial
  software components \TheProject relies on are open source. Most are
  very mature
  and supported by an active community, which offers strong long run
  guarantees.  The critical emerging software component Jupyter
  builds on \IPython which has been around for a decade and is very
  mature. The other components could be replaced by alternatives, or
  worst comes to worst, taken over by the participants.

  \\\hline

  \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{
    \textit{Management risks}
  }
  \\\hline

  Recruitment of highly qualified staff & High/Medium &
  Great care was taken identifying pool of candidates to hire from,
  and coordinating with currently running projects to rehire personnel
  with strong track record. Typically, we will rehire European
  postdocs that are currently funded by the Sloan grant to work on
  Jupyter in California and wish to come back to Europe.\\\hline

  Different groups not forming effective team & Medium/Low & Long
  track record of working collaboratively on code across multiple
  sites; Aggressive planning of project meetings, work-shops and
  one-to-one partner visits to facilitate most effective teamwork,
  combining face-to-face time at one site with remote
  collaboration.\\\hline 
  % this also justifies our generous travel budget.

  Partner leaves the consortium & Low/High & If the GA requires a replacement
  in order to achieve the project's objectives, the consortium will invite a new 
  relevant partner in. If a replacement is not necessary, the resources and tasks 
  of the departing partner will be reallocated to the alternative ones within the 
  consortium.
  \\\hline

  \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{
    \textit{Dissemination risks}
  }
  \\\hline

  Impact of dissemination activities is lower than planned. & Low/Medium & 
  Partners in the consortium have a proven track record of publishing in top-level 
  scientific venues with the highest impact, which reduces the risk. The Project Coordinator 
  will monitor impact of all dissemination activities. If a deficiency is identified, the consortium 
  will propose relevant corrective actions.\\\hline
