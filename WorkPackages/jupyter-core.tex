\begin{wpdescription}

Community-led open source software is critical to a sustainable future for open science.
Commonly used tools make up a shared infrastructure,
where investment in core components benefits the widest user community.
\TheProject is centred around the Jupyter project,
which is a collection of projects for interactive computing and
communicating computational ideas.

This work package is focused on developing and maintaining
the core of Jupyter.
In particular, we will help maintain these projects to meet the needs of the
Jupyter community, with a focus on needs for open science.
To serve the needs of \TheProject,
Jupyter core infrastructure will need improvements
to security, performance, and scalability,
which will be provided in \localtaskref{maintenance}.
In addition, we will develop new features in the core of Jupyter
to bring it to a wider audience,
and to improve its usefulness to those working toward open science practices,
including via collaboration features (\localtaskref{collaboration})
and accessibility (\localtaskref{accessibility}).
