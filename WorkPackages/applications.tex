  The objectives of this work package are
 \begin{compactitem}
   \item to guide the development of core tools by simultaneously
     developing and using applications in diverse fields with active
     scientists from these fields, and
   \item demonstrate that the tools we develop are valuable to diverse
     fields of science, thus ensuring we develop e-infrastructure and
     services which can cater for a broad customer base of EOSC.
 \end{compactitem}
\end{wpobjectives}

\begin{wpdescription}

  In order to ensure that the work we do is beneficial to science and
  society, we will develop applications in diverse domains, using the
  components developed in work packages \WPref{core} and
  \WPref{ecosystem}.

  By developing applications simultaneously with the core
  infrastructure and services, we ensure that we are serving
  real-world use cases with our development.  Feedback from
  applications development can guide development of core features.  In
  addition to helping ensure that our work is useful to the chosen
  application domains, the applications serve as demonstrations of
  this utility.

  One of the key aspects of Jupyter that make it the choice for
  \TheProject, is that it is generic, based on open protocols and
  widely useful in diverse domains, from physics to life sciences to
  education and the global community working with public and private
  data. We have selected a number of applications in a variety of domains
  to demonstrate the broad impact of \TheProject, in particular in the
  areas of education (\localtaskref{teaching}), photon science and
  imaging (\localtaskref{reproducibility-xfel}), astronomy
  (\localtaskref{astro}), geosciences (\localtaskref{geoscience}),
  mathematics (\localtaskref{math}) and health (\localtaskref{opendose-analysis}).
