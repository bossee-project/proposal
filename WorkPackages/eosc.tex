\begin{wpdescription}

This work package is focussed on developing and operating a publicly accessible
BinderHub service based in the EU.

The team of Project Binder provide a service at https://mybinder.org
which is public infrastructure powered by the software they develop.
mybinder.org is used to launch around 80000 "binders" every week and is
being used by researchers and teachers to make their work reproducible.

Although mybinder.org is very popular, there are currently only two
additional public BinderHubs worldwide. This means that there is a limited
expertise in operating and maintaining such public infrastructure.

In particular, we will help maintain the tools and documentation required
to operate public infrastructure like Binder to meet the needs of the
open-science community in the EU. In addition we will develop new features
for the BinderHub project that will bring it to a wider audience and improve
its usefulness for scientists based in the EU.
